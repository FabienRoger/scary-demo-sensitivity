# Scary demo sensitivity

This repository contains a demo of the sensitivity of the "snitching" scary demo to prompt variations.

The experiments are contained in `main_notebook.py`. They are relatively expensive to run, consider changing `default_n` and `special_combo_to_n` to run the prompts fewer times for the most expensive models.
